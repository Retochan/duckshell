# DuckShell (d-sh)

**DuckShell** is a lightweight command-line shell written in Rust, featuring plugin support, autocompletion, and a built-in plugin manager called `dupi`. Inspired by the simplicity and functionality of classic shells, it adds modern capabilities like installing plugins from `.pfds` files or URLs.
